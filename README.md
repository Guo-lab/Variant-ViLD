# Variant-ViLD
Just giving it a shot to change the backbone. I am a ML beginner. It might be a failure.  
It is much more like progress to learn how to build simple ViLD. The repo includes irrelevant examples but relevant to learning progress.  



The first part of the repo is from Alex's repo.

I hope to simplify extract the ViLD from ahthor's original repo and change the backbone in it.  



When I got lost, I start learning the book Hands-On-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-....
The repo for this book : https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2
