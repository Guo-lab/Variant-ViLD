# Variant-ViLD
Just giving it a shot to change the backbone. I am a object detection ML beginner. It is much more like a progress to learn how to build simple ViLD. The repo includes irrelevant examples but relevant to learning progress.  



The first part of the repo is from Alex's repo.

I hope to simply extract the ViLD from ahthor's original repo and change the backbone in it.  



When I got lost, I start learning the book Hands-On-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-....
The repo for this book : https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2


However, Changing the structure can also start with transfer learning. So, I am trying to transfer learn with some object detection models on 2022.9 and 2022.10, and hope I can do it with ViLD.

2022.10

I realize that maybe changing or embedding a new backbone of the ViLD directly is still far from me. This Variant-ViLD would be some projects relevant to Object Detection. 

Stands for Vision in Lab Daring (ㄒ﹏ㄒ)



2022.11 YOLOv5 I would give it a shot.
